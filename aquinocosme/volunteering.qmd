It was a gratifying responsibility to be the leader of this team that I trained since the beginning of the year for this event. The students from left to right: Renato Avalos, Kevin Aquino, and Guzman Shakur Rodriguez.

My gratitude to the Paraguayan Olympiad of Astronomy, Astronautics, and Astrophysics (OPAAA) and to the Astrophysics Club of Paraguay (CAP) for making our participation possible.
