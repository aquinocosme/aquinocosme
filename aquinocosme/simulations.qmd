## Fire Spread Simulation

In this project, I simulate the spread of a forest fire on a 100Ã—100 grid. Each cell in the grid can be in one of four states: tree (blue), grassland( light blue), burning tree (orange), or burnt tree (red). The goal is to understand how forest density influences fire spread, and to explore extensions such as the effect of wind.
